This platform can realistically simulate the impact of fog on LiDAR sensors and cameras, facilitating dynamic interaction between sensors and the environment.</li> <li>We design a time synchronization mechanism to ensure synchronization between ADSes and the simulator, ensuring the accuracy of test results. Importantly, our time synchronization mechanism operates transparently for ADSes.</li> <li>We conduct SOTIF tests on several representative ADSes from the CARLA Leaderboard under adverse weather conditions. Experimental results show that many issues undetectable in clear weather can be identified in adverse weather.</li> <li>We propose a safety-critical scenario generation and generalization algorithm that optimizes ordinary scenarios into accident scenarios (i.e., corner cases) and generalizes discovered corner cases to find more corner cases. Using this algorithm, we discover a series of corner cases in Baidu Apollo.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#demo","title":"Demo","text":""},{"location":"#source-code-installation-run","title":"Source Code Installation &amp; Run","text":""},{"location":"#result","title":"Result","text":"Case # Type Fog (m) Impact Layer Description Video Link 01 Rear-end collision 50 Collision Perception The ego vehicle is driving on a straight road, and the fog noise interferes with the ego vehicle's detection of NPC vehicles directly in front, resulting in a collision. Video 02 Lane change 100 Collision Perception When the ego vehicle is changing lanes and turning, due to fog noise, it did not recognize an NPC vehicle, resulting in a collision. Video 03 False positive (fog noise) 50 Stuck Perception The ego vehicle identifies the fog noise as an obstacle while driving, causing it to stuck. Video 04 False positive (standing water) 600 Stuck Perception The ego vehicle identifies the standing water ahead as a vehicle, causing it to stuck. Video 05 False positive (traffic light) 600 Stuck Planning The ego vehicle identifies the traffic lights as a vehicle at the T-junction at night, resulting in an abnormal stop. Video 06 False positive (wall) 30 Stuck Perception The ego vehicle identified the stone wall as a vehicle in front of the tunnel entrance, causing it to stop. Video 07 False negative (pedestrian) 50 Collision Perception When the ego vehicle turns right, it does not recognize pedestrians crossing the road, resulting in a collision. Video 08 False negative (motorcycle) 50 Collision Perception The ego vehicle does not detect the motorcycle ahead, resulting in a collision. Video 09 False negative (large vehicle) 30 Collision Perception The ego car collides with an ambulance turning left on the right at an intersection. Video 10 Uphill 100 Collision Perception A large amount of fog noise were generated in front of the ego vehicle when it was going uphill, resulting in the failure to recognize the vehicle in front and causing a collision. Video 11 Downhill 50 Collision Planning The ego vehicle did not detect vehicles downhill, resulting in a collision. Video 12 Detour 150 Detour/Stuck Planning When the ego vehicle does not completely change lanes, the route was re-planned, resulting in an abnormal stop.
