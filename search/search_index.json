However, as different configurations of a test scenario will affect the sensor perceptions and interaction with the environment, e.g. light pulses emitted by the LiDAR sensor will undergo back-scattering and attenuation, which is usually overlooked by existing works, leading to false positive or wrong results. Moreover, the input space of an ADS is extremely large, with infinite number of possible initial scenarios and mutations, along both temporal and spatial domains.</p> <p>This paper proposed a first-principles based sensor modeling and environment interaction scheme, and integrated it into CARLA simulator. With this scheme, a long-overlooked category of adverse weather related corner cases are discovered, along with their root causes. Moreover, a meta-heuristic algorithm was designed based on several empirical insights, which guide both seed scenarios and mutations, significantly reducing the search dimensions of scenarios and enhancing the efficiency of corner case identification. Experimental results showed that under identical simulation setups, our algorithm discovered about four times as many corner cases as compared to state-of-the-art work.</p>"},{"location":"#contribution","title":"Contribution","text":"<p>To address these challenges, This paper makes the following contributions:</p> <ul> <li>A first-principles based sensor modeling and interaction with the environment is proposed, which is further integrated into CARLA simulator. In our simulation, the long-overlooked safety issue in autonomous driving related to adverse weather is exposed.</li> <li>Different with existing fuzzing based methods, a meta-heuristic algorithm is designed based on several empirical insights. These insights guide both seed scenarios and mutations, significantly reducing the search dimensions of scenarios and enhancing the efficiency of corner case identification. Experimental results demonstrate that, under identical simulation environments and configurations, our algorithm discovers about four times as many corner cases in 100 simulation tests compared to the current state-of-the-art work.</li> <li>An eBPF-based synchronization mechanism is designed to bridge ADS and the simulator. This addresses the discrepancies in clock frequencies between the simulator and autonomous driving systems, significantly mitigating issues of false positives and negatives arising from asynchronous simulations in the domain.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#demo","title":"Demo","text":"Video Description When the main vehicle is driving on the road, it mistakenly identifies the water accumulation on the ground ahead as a vehicle, resulting in an abnormal stop. When the vehicle approaches an intersection, it mistakenly identifies the wall on the opposite side as a vehicle, mistakenly believing there is a car in front of it, leading to a stuck. The ego vehicle follows its planned route, and there is a slow-moving vehicle blocking its path up ahead. To continue, the ego vehicle decides to change lanes to the right and overtake the vehicle ahead from the right lane. After a successful overtaking maneuver, the wgo vehicle changes lanes back to the left, returning to its original lane. However, during the process of returning to the original lane, the ego vehicle comes to a stuck."},{"location":"#source-code-installation-run","title":"Source Code Installation &amp; Run","text":""},{"location":"#result","title":"Result","text":"Case # Type Fog (m) Impact Layer Description Video Link 01 Rear-end collision 50 Collision Perception The ego vehicle is driving on a straight road, and the fog noise interferes with the ego vehicle's detection of NPC vehicles directly in front, resulting in a collision. Video 02 Lane change 100 Collision Perception When the ego vehicle is changing lanes and turning, due to fog noise, it did not recognize an NPC vehicle, resulting in a collision. Video 03 False positive (fog noise) 50 Stuck Perception The ego vehicle identifies the fog noise as an obstacle while driving, causing it to stuck. Video 04 False positive (standing water) 600 Stuck Perception The ego vehicle identifies the standing water ahead as a vehicle, causing it to stuck. Video 05 False positive (traffic light) 600 Stuck Planning The ego vehicle identifies the traffic lights as a vehicle at the T-junction at night, resulting in an abnormal stop. Video 06 False positive (wall) 30 Stuck Perception The ego vehicle identified the stone wall as a vehicle in front of the tunnel entrance, causing it to stop. Video 07 False negative (pedestrian) 50 Collision Perception When the ego vehicle turns right, it does not recognize pedestrians crossing the road, resulting in a collision. Video 08 False negative (motorcycle) 50 Collision Perception The ego vehicle does not detect the motorcycle ahead, resulting in a collision.
